# 📝 Functional ToDo List App — Built with Python & Tkinter

This is my first **GUI-based ToDo List app** built using Python's Tkinter library.  
It’s a basic but fully functional desktop app where users can:

- ✅ Add tasks with timing
- ✅ Check off tasks as completed
- ✅ Maintain task state during app session

## 📸 Features

- Add tasks via a popup window
- Mark tasks as complete using checkboxes
- Tasks disappear when marked as done (optional)
- Tick status is retained as long as the app is running
